  %p.tldr tl;dr: You are a few clicks away from a configurable chef script for your OS-X development machine.

#sw-explained
  #sw-description
    %p Many teams use chef to manage their production machines, but developers often build their development boxes by hand.  SoloWizard makes it painless to create a configurable chef solo script to get your development machine humming: mysql, sublime text, .bash_profile tweaks to OS-X settings - it's all there!

      Dependencies: Xcode and OS-X Mountain Lion

          SoloWizard is built ontop of 3 popular and well supported open source projects:
          = "#{link_to 'Chef Solo', 'http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo', :target => '_blank'}, the #{link_to 'pivotal_workstation', 'https://github.com/pivotal/pivotal_workstation', :target => '_blank'} cookbook, and the #{link_to 'soloist', 'https://github.com/mkocher/soloist', :target => '_blank'} gem.".html_safe
          Soloist allows you to create chef-solo scripts with less boilerplate.  SoloWizard builds you a "Soloist shell script" which uses the pivotal_workstation chef recipes.

          Sorta.

            %strong Xcode:
            Many of the recipes use homebrew which require some utilites your mac doesn't have by default.
            You have 2 options: install Xcode from the App Store,
            or install the Xcode Command Line Tools from Apple's developer site.
            Xcode is a whopping 5GB's, so the command line tools are a faster download,
            but if you are interested in iPhone development, I would just go with Xcode.  Its up to you!

            %strong Mountain Lion:
            The most up-to-date pivotal_workstation recipes are only compatible with Mountain Lion.
            If you are on Lion and are willing to run recipes which are no longer supported, here are the steps:

          %ol
            %li
              Make sure you don't have any recipes checked which aren't present on the "last_lion_release" tag:
              = link_to "view the last_lion_release recipes", "https://github.com/pivotal/pivotal_workstation/tree/last_lion_release/recipes", :target => "_blank"
            %li Create a Solo Wizard script like normal
            %li Download the Solo Wizard shell script locally.
            %li
              Add the following line right before the line which has "soloist":
              %br
              %code cd pivotal_workstation && git checkout last_lion_release && cd ..

          Sure! You'll have the most up-to-date chef recipes either way!

          Some developers feel very strongly about this and some don't.
          So I give you both options: an easy one liner you can copy and paste -or- a link to download the script to your hard drive.
          Either way, I invite you to examine the shell script which Solo Wizard creates, it's the same as the
