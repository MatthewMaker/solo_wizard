  %p.tldr tl;dr: You are a few clicks away from a custom chef script for your OS-X development machine.

#sw-explained
  #sw-description
    %p Many teams use chef to manage their production machines, but developers often build their development boxes by hand.  SoloWizard makes it painless to create a customized chef solo script to get your development machine humming: mysql, sublime text, .bash_profile tweaks to OS-X settings - it's all there!
    %p
      Dependencies: OS-X Mountain Lion and Xcode

          SoloWizard is built ontop of 3 popular and well supported open source projects:
          = "#{link_to 'Chef Solo', 'http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo', :target => '_blank'}, the #{link_to 'pivotal_workstation', 'https://github.com/pivotal/pivotal_workstation', :target => '_blank'} cookbook, and the #{link_to 'soloist', 'https://github.com/mkocher/soloist', :target => '_blank'} gem.".html_safe

          Sorta.
          %p
            %strong Lion:
            If you are still on OS-X Lion, you can still use Solo Wizard, but you'll have to jump through a few hoops.
            The pivotal_workstation recipes only support Mountain Lion, but they did cut a tag "last_lion_release" tag.
            WARNING: Because the Lion recipes are no longer supported by the pivotal_workstation maintainers, you may run into issues with the recipes not working...
          %ol
            %li
              Uncheck any recipes which aren't on the last_lion_release tag:
              = link_to "view the lion recipes", "https://github.com/pivotal/pivotal_workstation/tree/last_lion_release/recipes"
            %li Create the Solo Wizard script like normal
            %li Download the Solo Wizard shell script locally.
            %li
              After the git clone statement, add the following:
              %br
              %code git checkout last_lion_release
            %li Run the script and hope for the best!

          %p
            %strong Xcode:
            Many of the recipes use homebrew which requires either XCode or the XCode Command Line Tools.  Xcode is a 5Gb download and can be downloaded from the Mac Store, while the Xcode Command Line Tools are much smaller but require an apple developer account - the choice is yours.

        .right Can I run Solo Wizard multiple times?

      .answer
        .left A:
        .right
          Sure! The first time you run Solo Wizard it will clone the pivotal_workstation git repo. If you run it again, it will pull down any updates.
